          a) this is an arbitray value, we would need to see when the icon doesnt fit anymore
          b) hiding it with css still keeps it around in the dom. For an icon this doesnt matter but maybe for other content
          => this would require a more sophisticated approach for each component with a resizeObserver or a global matchMedia approach
